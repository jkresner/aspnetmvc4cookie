aspnetmvc4cookie
===========================

This project is a cookie cutter base project template for asp .net mvc 4 based on experience from starting many projects/code bases over the past few years.

It is how I currently like to set up a new asp .net mvc project using mostly SPA single page application architecture with Mvc4 WebApi json rest services.

The commits contain details about what I like (& don't like) parts of the default asp .net mvc 4 templates. 

The order of the commits are important. They also demonstrate how I customize my projects based on experience and include bits of goodness from other places including Backbone.js / Twitter Bootstrap etc.
